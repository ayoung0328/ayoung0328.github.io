    		<h2>What is Git?</h2>
			<p>A hosting platform for users to collaborate, create and review code by using repositories, branches, commits and pull requests.</p>
		<h2>Who Started Git?</h2>
			<p>Linus Torvalds invented Git.</p>
		<h2>What is Hub?</h2>
			<p>Hub is a command line wrapper for git. It helps in getting repositories, forking repos, navigating through project pages and submitting pull requests. </p>
		<h2>Describe Repository and its role.</h2>
		<p>Repositories are used to organize a project and contains items like videos, spreadsheets, data sets and files and images. </p>
		<h2>Your thoughts about GitHub</h2>
		<p>I've had a GitHub account for a while now and realized that others used it for collaboration but haven't utilized it fully. I can see where it will definitely come in handy
		with a group project and look forward to using it this way. Seeing every iteration and commits could be useful in determining what you are doing right or wrong when coding.</p>
